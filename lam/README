LAM - Readme
============

  LDAP Account Manager (LAM) manages user, group and host accounts in an LDAP
  directory. LAM runs on any webserver with PHP 8 support and connects to your
  LDAP server unencrypted or via SSL/TLS.
  Currently LAM supports these account types: Samba 3/4, Unix, Kolab,
  address book entries, NIS mail aliases and MAC addresses. There is a tree
  viewer included to allow access to the raw LDAP attributes. You can use
  templates for account creation and use multiple configuration profiles.
