  <section id="a_configPasswords">
    <title>LAM configuration passwords</title>

    <para>LAM supports a two level authorization system for its configuration.
    Therefore, there are two types of configuration passwords:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">master configuration password:</emphasis>
        needed to change general settings, create/delete server profiles and
        self service profiles</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">server profile password:</emphasis> used
        to change the settings of a server profile (e.g. LDAP server and
        account types to manage)</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The master configuration password can be used to reset a server
    profile password. Each server profile has its own profile password.</para>

    <para>Both password types are stored as hash values in the configuration
    files for enhanced security.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Use of SSL</title>

    <para>The data which is transferred between you and LAM is very sensitive.
    Please always use SSL encrypted connections between LAM and your browser
    to protect yourself against network sniffers.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>LDAP with SSL and TLS</title>

    <para>SSL will be used if you use ldaps://servername in your configuration
    profile. TLS can be activated with the "Activate TLS" option.</para>

    <para>If your LDAP server uses a SSL certificate of a well-know
    certificate authority (CA) then you probably need no changes. If you use a
    custom CA in your company then there are two ways to setup the CA
    certificates.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Setup SSL certificates in LAM general settings</title>

      <para>This is much easier than system level setup and will only affect
      LAM. There might be some cases where other web applications on the same
      web server are influenced.</para>

      <para>See <link linkend="conf_sslCert">here</link> for details.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="ssl_certSystem">
      <title>Setup SSL certificates on system level</title>

      <para>This will make the CA certificates available also to other
      applications on your system (e.g. other web applications).</para>

      <para>You will need to setup ldap.conf to trust your server certificate.
      Some installations use /etc/ldap.conf and some use /etc/ldap/ldap.conf.
      It is a good idea to symlink /etc/ldap.conf to /etc/ldap/ldap.conf.
      Specify the server CA certificate with the following option:</para>

      <programlisting>TLS_CACERT /etc/ldap/ca/myCA/cacert.pem</programlisting>

      <para>This needs to be the public part of the signing certificate
      authority. See "man ldap.conf" for additional options.</para>

      <literallayout>
</literallayout>

      <para>You may also need to specify the CA certificate in your Apache
      configuration by using the option "LDAPTrustedGlobalCert":</para>

      <programlisting>LDAPTrustedGlobalCert CA_BASE64 /etc/ldap/ca/myCA/cacert.pem</programlisting>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section id="selinux">
    <title>Selinux</title>

    <para>In case your server has selinux installed you might need to extend
    the selinux ruleset. E.g. your webserver might not be allowed to write in
    /var/lib.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Read selinux status</emphasis></para>

    <para>The following command will tell you if selinux is running in
    Enforcing or Permissive mode.</para>

    <para>Enforcing: access that does not match rules is denied</para>

    <para>Permissive: access that does not match rules is granted but logged
    to audit.log</para>

    <programlisting>getenforce</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Set selinux to Permissive
    mode</emphasis></para>

    <para>This will just log any access violations. You will need this to get
    a list of missing rights.</para>

    <programlisting>setenforce Permissive</programlisting>

    <para>Now do any actions inside LAM that you need for your daily work
    (e.g. edit server profiles, manage LDAP entries, ...).</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Extend selinux rules</emphasis></para>

    <para>Selinux now has logged any violations to audit.log. You can use this
    now to extend your ruleset and enable enforcing later.</para>

    <para>The following example is for httpd. You can also adapt it to e.g.
    nginx.</para>

    <programlisting># build additional selinux rules from audit.log
grep httpd /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -m httpdlocal -o httpdlocal.te
</programlisting>

    <para>The httpdlocal.te might look like this:</para>

    <programlisting>module httpdlocal 1.0;

require {
        type httpd_t;
        type var_lib_t;
        class file { setattr write };
}

#============= httpd_t ==============

#!!!! WARNING 'httpd_t' is not allowed to write or create to var_lib_t.  Change the label to httpd_var_lib_t.
#!!!! $ semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_var_lib_t /var/lib/ldap-account-manager/config/lam.conf
#!!!! $ restorecon -R -v /var/lib/ldap-account-manager/config/lam.conf
allow httpd_t var_lib_t:file { setattr write };
</programlisting>

    <para>Now we can compile and install this rule:</para>

    <programlisting># build module
checkmodule -M -m -o httpdlocal.mod httpdlocal.te
# package module
semodule_package -o httpdlocal.pp -m httpdlocal.mod
# install module
semodule -i httpdlocal.pp</programlisting>

    <para>Now you can switch back to Enforcing mode:</para>

    <programlisting>setenforce Enforcing</programlisting>

    <para>LAM should now work as expected with active selinux.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Chrooted servers</title>

    <para>If your server is chrooted and you have no access to /dev/random or
    /dev/urandom this can be a security risk. LAM stores your LDAP password
    encrypted in the session. LAM uses rand() to generate the key if
    /dev/random and /dev/urandom are not accessible. Therefore the key can be
    easily guessed. An attaker needs read access to the session file (e.g. by
    another Apache instance) to exploit this.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Protection of your LDAP password and directory contents</title>

    <para>You have to install the OpenSSL extension for PHP to enable
    encryption.</para>

    <para>Your LDAP password is stored encrypted in the session file. The key
    and IV to decrypt it are stored in two cookies. We use OpenSSL/AES to
    encrypt the password. All data that was read from LDAP and needs to be
    stored in the session file is also encrypted.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="apache">
    <title>Apache configuration</title>

    <section>
      <title>Sensitive directories</title>

      <para>LAM includes several .htaccess files to protect your configuration
      files and temporary data. Apache is often configured to not use
      .htaccess files by default. Therefore, please check your Apache
      configuration and change the override setting to:</para>

      <para>AllowOverride All</para>

      <para>If you are experienced in configuring Apache then you can also
      copy the security settings from the .htaccess files to your main Apache
      configuration.</para>

      <para>If possible, you should not rely on .htaccess files but also move
      the config and sess directory to a place outside of your WWW root. You
      can put a symbolic link in the LAM directory so that LAM finds the
      configuration/session files.</para>

      <para>Security sensitive directories:</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">config: </emphasis>Contains your LAM
      configuration and account profiles</para>

    </section>

    <section id="apache_http_auth">
      <title>Use LDAP HTTP authentication for LAM</title>

      <para>With HTTP authentication Apache will be responsible to ask for the
      user name and password. Both will then be forwarded to LAM which will
      use it to access LDAP. This approach gives you more flexibility to
      restrict the number of users that may access LAM (e.g. by requiring
      group memberships).</para>

      <para>First of all you need to load additional Apache modules. These are
      "<ulink
      url="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_ldap.html">mod_ldap</ulink>"
      and "<ulink type=""
      url="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_authnz_ldap.html">mod_authnz_ldap</ulink>".</para>

      <para>Next you can add a file called "lam_auth_ldap" to
      /etc/apache/conf.d. This simple example restricts access to all URLs
      beginning with "lam" to LDAP authentication.</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;location /lam&gt;
  AuthType Basic
  AuthBasicProvider ldap
  AuthName "LAM"
  AuthLDAPURL "ldap://localhost:389/ou=People,dc=company,dc=com?uid"
  Require valid-user
&lt;/location&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>You can also require that your users belong to a certain Unix
      group in LDAP:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;location /lam&gt;
  AuthType Basic
  AuthBasicProvider ldap
  AuthName "LAM"
  AuthLDAPURL "ldap://localhost:389/ou=People,dc=company,dc=com?uid"
  Require valid-user
  # force membership of lam-admins
  AuthLDAPGroupAttribute memberUid
  AuthLDAPGroupAttributeIsDN off
  Require ldap-group cn=lam-admins,ou=group,dc=company,dc=com
&lt;/location&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Please see the <ulink
      url="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_authnz_ldap.html">Apache
      documentation</ulink> for more details.</para>

      <title>Self Service behind proxy in DMZ (LAM Pro)</title>

      <para>In some cases you might want to make the self service accessible
      via the internet. Here is an Apache config to forward only the required
      URLs via a proxy server (lamproxy.company.com) in your DMZ to the
      internal LAM server (lam.company.com).</para>

    <para>There is no fully automatic setup of Nginx but LAM provides a
    ready-to-use configuration file.</para>

    <section>
      <title>RPM based installations</title>

      <para>The RPM package has dependencies on Apache. Therefore, Nginx is
      not officially supported with this installation mode. Use tar.bz2 if you
      are unsure.</para>

      <para>However, the package also includes an Nginx configuration file.
      Please include it in your server directive like this:</para>

      <programlisting>server {
        ...

        include /etc/ldap-account-manager/lam.nginx.conf;

        ...
}</programlisting>

      <para>The included config file uses PHP 5. In case you run with PHP 7
      please update the parameter "fastcgi_pass" to
      "/var/run/php7-fpm.sock".</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>DEB based installations</title>

      <para>The LAM installation package ships with an Nginx configuration

        include /etc/ldap-account-manager/nginx.conf;

        ...
}</programlisting>

      <para>The included config file uses PHP 7.0. In case you run with PHP

      <title>tar.bz2 based installations</title>

      <para>Please add the following configuration snippet to your server
      directive.</para>

      <para>You will need to change the alias location
      ("/usr/share/ldap-account-manager") and fastcgi_pass (e.g.
      "/var/run/php5-fpm.sock" or "/var/run/php7-fpm.sock") to match your

    means your users login with their LDAP password and an additional hardware
    token (e.g. Yubico Security Key, Windows Hello and many more).</para>

    <para>Webauthn/FIDO2 is a very strong 2-factor-authentication method as it
    also checks the website domain. This prevents attacks via web

    <para>To use this feature you need to activate the 2-factor authentication
    in LAM.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">LAM admin interface</emphasis></para>

    <para>Please activate Webauthn/FIDO2 in your <link
